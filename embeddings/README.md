## Datasets (pre-trained embeddings)

1. Download the code, pre-trained models, and datasets following the instruction from [LaplacianShot github](https://github.com/imtiazziko/LaplacianShot)
2. Copy the src directory of Laplacian-repo and place in ./embeddings
   * Ex) ./embeddings/src
3. Move the pre-trained models into ./embeddings/pretrained
   * Ex) ./embeddings/pretrained/mini/softmax/wideres
4. Modify `DATA_PATH_TO_MINI/DATA_PATH_TO_MINI/DATA_PATH_TO_MINI`  in "embeddings.py" to appropriate path
5. Run "embeddings.py" will create pkl files of pre-trained embeddings.
